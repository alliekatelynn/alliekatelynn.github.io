            <p>Hello, my name is Allie Monday. I was born in Dayton, Ohio and lived in Cincinnati but I did most of my growing up in Charlotte, North Carolina.  I was very active growing up. I played most sports at least once but I spent most of my time as a competitive dancer. I also spent a lot of my free time studying music as well as performing in various musicals throughout Charlotte. I am a strong Christian and my faith is extremely important to me. It has played a major part in making me the individual I am today and I believe I would not be where I'm at without Jesus Christ.</p>
        
            <p>I have been a musician since I can remember. I sing as well as play guitar and piano. My passion for music is what sent me to college in Nashville, Tennessee attending Belmont University. I originally enrolled as a Commercial Music Voice major studying the art and craft of singing with a secondary study in piano. Half way through my time at Belmont I decided I wanted to switch majors due to feeling like, although I was growing as a musician, me and a ton of many other musicians in the world are lacking in knowledge on how to navigate the nasty and political music business itself. In December of 2017, I graduated with a Bachelors of Business Administration in Music Business. </p>

            <p>Since graduating I moved back home to Charlotte to have my daughter. Her name is Cadence Monday, she was born on November 12, 2017, and she is my world. As a single mother my priorities have shifted leading me to pursue a potential secondary passion in coding in efforts to stay near my support system as well as raise my little girl. I thoroughly enjoy mathematics, problem solving, and I am naturally creative so I believe development will be a good path for me.</p>
                
            <p>Digital marketing and branding are keys to success in the music buisness making development a great asset to my degree if I'm ever able to build a career in music business later on. Until then, I am excited about what is to come in the future and I look forward to growing as a mother, as a musician, and now as a developer.</p>
